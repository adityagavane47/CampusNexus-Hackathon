## 🚀 Step 1: Discovery (The AI Skill-Matcher)

Aravind logs into **CampusNexus**.
Instead of scrolling through hundreds of generic posts, he navigates to the **✨ AI Match** tab.

1.  He enters his project idea: *"A decentralized scholarship platform for students."*
2.  The **CampusNexus AI** scans the on-chain profiles of other students.
3.  It matches him with **Sanya**, a 2nd-year student with a *Gold-Tier Design Badge* (verified on-chain).

> *"Perfect match found: Sanya (UI/UX Designer). Trust Score: 98/100."*

## 🤝 Step 2: The Agreement (MilestoneEscrow)

Aravind contacts Sanya. They agree to collaborate. To ensure fairness, they use the **MilestoneEscrow** smart contract.

1.  Aravind initializes a contract: *"Design 3 UI Screens for 50 ALGO."*
2.  He connects his **Pera Wallet** and locks the funds.
3.  Sanya sees the offer and signs the contract with her wallet.

> *Status: 🔒 Funds Locked in Escrow. Waiting for submission.*

## ✅ Step 3: Completion & Reputation (Hustle-Score)

Three days later...

1.  Sanya uploads the designs.
2.  Aravind reviews them on the **Marketplace** dashboard. They are perfect!
3.  Aravind clicks **"Approve Milestone"**.
4.  **Smart Contract Action**:
    *   💸 **50 ALGO** are instantly released to Sanya.
    *   📈 **Sanya's Hustle-Score** automatically increases by +10 points.
    *   🏆 She receives a **"Reliable Collaborator" SBT** (Soulbound Token) minted directly to her address.

**Result**: Aravind got his designs, Sanya got paid instantly, and her on-chain reputation grew, helping her land her next gig. This is the power of **CampusNexus**.
